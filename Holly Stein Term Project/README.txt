Welcome to Bond Sweeper!

WHAT IS BOND SWEEPER?
Bond Sweeper resembles the classic Microsoft game of Minesweeper. For more information
on Minesweeper, see the Wikipedia article at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)
Bond sweeper is different from Minesweeper, however, as it is played on a world map. 
Each country represents a tile on the classic Minesweeper board. The game has global 
trivia and fun facts incorporated in it in order to increase geographical literacy
through a simple, enjoyable game.

WHY IS IT CALLED 'BOND SWEEPER'?
Rather than planting mines across the globe, it made more sense, in terms of 
promoting world peace, to plant a spy, JamesBond, hidden in various countries. Think 
'Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?'

SETTING UP BOND SWEEPER
Bond Sweeper requires .gif and .txt files that come with it in order to run, so it 
is imporatant to run the program from a folder that contains the accompanying files. 
As long as all the files are in the same folder, simply run the file ________ as a 
python file from the terminal of your choice. 

INSTRUCTIONS
This game is similar to the classic Microsoft game of Minesweeper, but with a few 
twists. The goal of Bond Sweeper is to uncover all countries that James Bond is not 
in. The underlying goal is to learn the countries of a continent of your choosing. 
In terms of Minesweeper, Bond would be a mine and countries are tiles. When a 
country is uncovered, a number appears on it that tells you how many of that 
countries adjacent countries Bond is in. You win the game by uncovering all the 
countries Bond is not in. Left-click a country to uncover it. If it is a zero, all 
adjacent countries are automatically uncovered. If it is a bomb, don’t worry! You 
have the chance to save your game by answering a trivia question about the continent 
you’re playing in, or about the world. If you suspect Bond is in a country, 
right-click it to turn it red, making it un-clickable. When you mark a country, a 
dialog box appears and you must correctly name the country you are attempting to 
mark. A list of possible countries is given. If you answer incorrectly, it’s game 
over. If you right-click a marked box, it turns into a question, for puzzle solving 
purposes. Since learning all the countries in a continent can be overwhelming, a 
review mode is available for each continent. In review mode, simply roll over a 
country and its name will appear. You may need to return to the main menu to begin
a game. Good luck!

IS IT EFFECTIVE?
Yes! After playing the game extensively myself and watching peers play it, there are a
number of key reasons why this game appears to be effective:
1. Winning requires learning countries' names, and players want to win. Thus, rather
   than learning through tedious, exhausting repetition, players learn through
   self-motivation.
2. Winning also requires thinking about the shape of each country. Rather than just 
   learning the names of countries and roughly their location, players must understand
   exactly where the country is situated in relation to other countries.
3. If a player doesn't win, it is easy to start a new game. Human nature dictates that
   players often will start a new game when they lose.
