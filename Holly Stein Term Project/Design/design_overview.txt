BASIC DESIGN
My project is the game of minesweeper played on a world map. The game is written so
that it is played on top of a picture of a blank map. That is, the program does not
interact with the background. Within the program, each country is an instance of a 
class where its unique attributes are stored. Then, each country is stored in a 
dictionary of countries, where the country name is the key and the instance of the 
country is the value. 

When the mouse is clicked, methods are called within the class
to determine whether to uncover it, or to open a dialog box. When the user attempts to
place a flag and is prompted to name the country, the list of possible countries is
more likely to be filled with countries nearer to the country clicked rather than 
those that are farther away. 

USER INTERFACE
The user interface is designed to be easy to use. For example, when a country is 
scrolled over, because it can be difficult to see which countries neighbor which
other countries, the adjacent countries' boxes change color. There is also a review 
feature for those players who need to brush up on their geography before playing.
The main menu is accessible at all times in order to change continents, and the 
instructions are also available at any time in case a player doesn't understand an
aspect of the game.
