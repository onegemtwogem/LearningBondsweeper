HOLLY'S UPDATES

FIRST UPDATE
Since last deliverable, I have written all the code I have so far. 

I have made changes to how the program works from how I imagined it to work. Currently, mouse clicks 
are only registered within a box in each country, rather than within the countries borders. I have also
decided to start off by only using a map of Europe, rather than the entire world. 

SECOND UPDATE
. Both left and right clicking works properly.
. When you uncover a country that touches no mines, all adjacent countries are uncovered. This is a standard 
  minesweeper feature
. There is a start screen with a "begin" button and an "instructions" button.
. When a country is right-clicked, a window appears asking the player to type in the name of the country. The
  options for countries given are more likely to be neighboring countries than not. 
. Water! (for Europe)
. James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) appears when a mined country is clicked
. when you print "Game over," diagnose the problem, say "you uncovered a mine" or "wrong country"
. Trivia to save yourself if you press a mine/Bond finds you
. Review countries
. Lots of facts
. Instructions as a text file
. Options are weighted with a PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION that uses RECURSION to calculate probabilities for each step from the country clicked
. Marked countries are not left-clickable
. prints number of remaining mines
. QUADTREES: quadrants, each quad is a key that maps to the countries in that quad, then, when reviewing (or any looping), check only in that quadrant
. hovering over a country highlights the neighbors


SUGGESTIONS:
# L+R click displays all adj non-mines iff all adj mines are flagged, ugh timer
. click anywhere in country rather than just in the box
. more than just europe => the zooming in thing across the whole globe
. get facts in real time NOOOOOO DON'T DO IT
# hard to read country names
. other continents
. Leaderboard!
. incorporate some list (?) comprehensions (in the method 'getOptions')
. type in country: say if you are right, otherwise (when game is over) say the country name
. increase quality of photo
. Levels! capitals? no country options given? (just type in the name)
# polish user interface
. the zoom thing we talked about, eehhhh
. add comments and test functions if you have time, style in general
. connect continents, use an algorithm, play as a whole board where you switch between windows, or is that too annoying?
. delete print command that prints location of a mouse click
