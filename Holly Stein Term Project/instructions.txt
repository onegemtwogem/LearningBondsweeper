Welcome to Bondsweeper! This game is similar to the classic Microsoft game of Minesweeper, but with a few twists. The goal of Bondsweeper is to uncover all countries that James Bond is not in. The underlying goal is to learn the countries of a continent of your choosing. In terms of Minesweeper, Bond would be a mine and countries are tiles. When a country is uncovered, a number appears on it that tells you how many of that countries adjacent countries Bond is in. You win the game by uncovering all the countries Bond is not in. Left-click a country to uncover it. If it is a zero, all adjacent countries are automatically uncovered. If it is a bomb, don’t worry! You have the chance to save your game by answering a trivia question about the continent you’re playing in, or about the world. If you suspect Bond is in a country, right-click it to turn it red, making it un-clickable. When you mark a country, a dialog box appears and you must correctly name the country you are attempting to mark. A list of possible countries is given. If you answer incorrectly, it’s game over. If you right-click a marked box, it turns into a question, for puzzle solving purposes. Good luck!
